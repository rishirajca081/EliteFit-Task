# Answers to technical questions

**Question 1** 


> How long did you spend on the coding test? 

**Answer :** 
> I spent around 12 to 15 hours working on the coding test for my EliteFit Task. During this time, I focused on implementing key features such as task creation, updating, deletion, and categorization. My goal was to optimize the functionality and ensure a smooth user experience while working within the given timeframe.

**Question 2**
> What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

**Answer :**   

> 
The most useful feature added in the latest version of React (React 19) is arguably the React Compiler.<br/>
This new feature optimizes React code by compiling components directly to JavaScript, reducing the need for developers to manually use performance optimization hooks like useMemo and useCallback.<br/>
And in this currect project i did not use the hooks useMemo and useCallback.

**Question 3**
> How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

**Answer :** 
- Check the browser's developer tools for any console errors or performance warnings.<br/>
- Use a web performance testing tool like Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to identify specific areas for improvement.<br/>
- Monitor the site's network requests and response times using the browser's network panel.<br/>
- Analyze the site's server logs for any errors or slow processing times.<br/>
- Profile the JavaScript code to identify performance bottlenecks.<br/>
- Inspect the site's structure and assets (images, CSS, JS) to ensure they are optimized for performance.<br/>
- Consider implementing server-side caching or a content delivery network (CDN) to improve response times.<br/>

**Question 4**

> If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?


**Answer :**

>  **User Authentication**: Allowing users to log in and save their tasks across sessions.<br/>
**Automated Notifications**: Set up reminders for due dates via email or sms notifications<br/>
**Progress Tracking**: I will add a progress bar for each task to visually track completion.<br/>
**API Endpoints**: Create RESTful APIs for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.<br/>
